{.myfancyclass} Imagine a stranger coming up to you and patting you softly on your head. It would be bizarre if this happened to you in the real world. However, if you were hanging out on a social VR platform such as _VRChat_ in a cute animal avatar, such an act could be expected and even welcomed. Social interactions in VR do not need to follow the existing conventions of the real world, as they can make use of the unique possibilities in a virtual reality that is not bound to the rules of the physical world.

In a connected world, social VR gives you the ability to experience meaningful, close connection with others online in new ways. For one, the ability to embody an avatar in VR gives you a new sort of grasp on the digital world—it lets you physically interact with another person over the internet. However, the potential of social VR does not stop there. In my master's thesis, I set out to explore how novel interaction possibilities in social VR can transform our experiences of intimacy and close connection over the internet.

The result of my thesis was Firefly Island, a virtual world in the social VR platform Neos. Firefly Island was designed to be a world for two people to experience intimacy. It did not matter if they were two strangers meeting for the first time, or if they were a couple who had known each other for a long time—the world had activities that were designed to be interdependent, bringing people closer through play, exploration, and self-disclosure.
