          Hi, Iâ€™m Savio. I create XR experiences that are social and playful by
          design. As an interaction designer, I ideate and prototype spatial
          interactions that push the boundaries of XR interfaces. Iâ€™m currently
          open to full-time roles in XR interaction design and UX design.
