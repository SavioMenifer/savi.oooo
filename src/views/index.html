          Hi, I’m Savio. I create VR experiences that are social and playful by
          design. As an interaction designer, I explore VR design opportunities
          that make use of the unique possibilities of VR. I’m currently doing
          an internship at
          <a href="https://www.studio-vrij.com/" target="_blank">Studio VRij</a
          >, where I’m working on a social VR game.
