          Growing up alongside the internet, I have always had a fascination for
          how the web can bring people and ideas together. My passion lies in
          exploring and redefining how we use technology to create, learn, and
          connect. Here is a glimpse into who I am and what drives me.

            <h4>Design 🎨</h4>
            <p>
              As an interaction technologist, my main skill lies in designing
              impactful experiences. I combine visual, UX, and interaction
              design to achieve cohesive end results.
            </p>

          <div class="about-tile tile2">
            <h4>Tech 👨‍💻</h4>
            <p>
              With a background in programming, I am able to bring my designs to
              life through interactive prototypes. I am also always eager to
              learn about new tech stacks and tools.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-tile tile3">
            <h4>Ideation 🌟</h4>
            <p>
              I am always seeking out creative solutions to problems. I do this
              by drawing inspiration from varied sources and mixing and matching
              concepts to create new perspectives.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-tile tile4">
            <h4>Deliberation 🧐</h4>
            <p>
              One of my biggest strengths is my desire to do things in an
              attentive and deliberate way. I try not to skimp on the details,
              even if it's something that has a small impact.

          <div class="about-tile tile5">
            <h4>Playfulness 👻</h4>
            <p>
              Games and play are fun! But besides that, I also believe that a
              playful approach can often be beneficial to solve serious
              problems.

          <div class="about-tile tile6">
            <h4>Openness 🌈</h4>
            <p>
              Great things can be built through a diverse and multidisciplinary
              approach. I value being adaptable and open at all times.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-tile tile7">
            <h4>Inspiration 💫</h4>
            <p>
              The things that inspire me help me to grow. I find it important to
              surround myself in an environment that inspires and drives me.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-tile tile8">
            <h4>Learning 🙋</h4>
            <p>
              I cherish being able to constantly learn (and unlearn!) things.
              Curiosity, exploration, and discovery are always close to my
              heart.
