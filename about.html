        <p>
          I am a designer who loves tinkering and discovery. I work with
          emerging technology to create experiences that let us use our full
          range of human capabilities. In my downtime, I listen to 90s trip hop
          and downtempo music, do DIY stuff, and create

            <h4>Design 🎨</h4>
            <p>
              I combine visual, UX, and interaction design to create new
              experiences. The core of design to me involves defining the
              problem well and keeping the overall goal in mind at each step.

          <div class="about-tile tile2">
            <h4>Technology ⚡</h4>
            <p>
              I love tinkering with terminals and code. Programming and
              prototyping are essential companions to my work. I enjoy learning
              and reading up on the latest tech and tools.

          <div class="about-tile tile3">
            <h4>Ideation 🌟</h4>
            <p>
              I am always seeking out creative solutions to problems. I do this
              by drawing inspiration from varied sources and mixing and matching
              concepts to create new perspectives.
            </p>

          <div class="about-tile tile4">
            <h4>Collaboration 🙌</h4>
            <p>
              I believe that the best work is done in a culture of
              collaboration. I thrive when I'm working with passionate
              people—combining forces and creating impact together.

            <h4>Playfulness 👻</h4>
            <p>
              Games and play are fun! But besides that, I also believe that a
              playful approach can often be beneficial to solve serious
              problems.

            <h4>Openness 🌈</h4>
            <p>
              Great things can be built only through multidisciplinary,
              inclusive approaches. I value being adaptable and open at all
              times.

            <h4>Inspiration 💫</h4>
            <p>
              The things that inspire me help me to grow. I find it important to
              surround myself in an environment that inspires and drives me.

          <div class="about-tile tile8">
            <h4>Learning 🙋</h4>
            <p>
              I cherish being able to constantly learn (and unlearn) things.
              Curiosity, exploration, and discovery are always close to my
              heart.
